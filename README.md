# webster

Will need new example site (this one doesn't work): https://bochs.info/webster/ - interface to webster 1913 unabridged

## Plan

- [ ] Develop a flask/docker setup for easy install
- [ ] Develop a pwa to present the dictionary
- [ ] Maybe improve looks (don't know how it looks yet)
  - Inspiration: https://webster1913.com/
